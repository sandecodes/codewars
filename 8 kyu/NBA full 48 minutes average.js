/*

An NBA game runs 48 minutes (Four 12 minute quarters). Players do not typically play the full game, subbing in and out as necessary. Your job is to extrapolate a player's points per game if they played the full 48 minutes.

Write a function that takes two arguments, ppg (points per game) and mpg (minutes per game) and returns a straight extrapolation of ppg per 48 minutes rounded to the nearest tenth. Return 0 if 0.

Examples:

pointsPer48(12, 20) // 28.8
pointsPer48(10, 10) // 48 
pointsPer48(5, 17) // 14.1 
pointsPer48(0, 0) // 0
Notes:
All inputs will be either be an integer or float.
Follow your dreams!

const pointsPer48 = (ppg, mpg) => {
  if (ppg === 0 || mpg === 0) return 0;
  return Math.round((ppg / mpg) * 48 * 10) / 10;
};

console.log(pointsPer48(12, 20), 28.8);
console.log(pointsPer48(10, 10), 48.0);
console.log(pointsPer48(5, 17), 14.1);
console.log(pointsPer48(0, 0), 0);
console.log(pointsPer48(30.8, 34.7), 42.6); // Russell Westbrook 1/15/17
console.log(pointsPer48(22.9, 33.8), 32.5); // Kemba Walker 1/15/17
